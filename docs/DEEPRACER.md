# AWS DeepRacer

## What is the AWS DeepRacer?
AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18th scale race car developed by AWS. It is also combined with a cloud based 3D racing simulator, and a global racing league. It is a great platform to get started on Reinforcement Learning as well. Reinforcement Learning is a different and faster approach well suited for learning complex behaviours without training data. It uses sim2real learning to transfer the learning from a console environment in AWS It was first announced at Re:Invent 2018.

## Why did we choose AWS DeepRacer?
AWS DeepRacer allows us to stretch the boundaries of our project. Due to its inclusion we have been able to work in a multi-cloud fashion incorporating the best parts of Google Cloud and AWS. Also, the immense community support behind AWS DeepRacer means that we can explore and dig deeper into the possiblities. 

## What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement Learning uses agents and an environment in order to perform training even without labeled data. For more information, go to LEARNING.md
